		<h3>
			The Java Runtime Environment
		</h3>
		<p>
			To run the Dark Tower game you need the Java Runtime Environment J2SE 1.4.0 (JRE)
			or the Java Software Development Kit J2SE 1.4.0 (SDK). You can download it from 
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/downloads.html">http://java.sun.com/downloads.html</a>.
			After installing the Java Runtime Environment you can start the game by double
			clicking on the <i>darktower.jar</i> file. If this does not work you can start
			the game by typing <pre>javaw.exe -jar darktower.jar</pre> at the DOS-Prompt or by
			using the <i>darktower.cmd</i> batch file.

			The Challenge
		</h3>
		<p>
			Retrieve the Ancient Magic Scepter that has been stolen by a tyrant king.
			The Scepter is the Power Staff of the Empire and a Kingdom has been
			offered for its return. It now lays hidden in the Dark Tower guarded by the
			tyrant's fierce band of Brigands. Three magic keys will open the tower to
			you. Find the keys in three foreign kingdoms on the gameboard and you can
			lay siege to the Dark Tower.
		<p>
			In search of the keys, leave the Citadel in your home kingdom with 10 warriors,
			30 bags of gold and 25 rations of food. On your journey, you will fight
			battles, be attacked by dragons, lose warriors to plague and starvation and
			get hopelessly lost in uncharted territories.
		<p>
			But don't despair! Visit the Bazaars to buy warriors and other supplies. Stop
			at the Mines and Ruins to discover treasures of gold, Dragonswords, magic
			keys, helpful wizards and the Flying Horse, Pegasus. The Sanctuaries are
			open to you, too, ready to outfit you with warriors, gold and food.
		<p>
			Once you discover the three keys, begin your siege of the Dark Tower. Start
			out by solving the Ancient Riddle of the Keys, then fight the Brigands
			within!
		<p>
			If you have a stoutheart, quick wits and undying courage, you will retrieve
			the Scepter, save the Empire and win a Kingdom.

		<h3>
			Where To Move On The Gameboard
		</h3>
		<p>
			The world of Dark Tower is divided into 4 kingdoms of Arisilon, Brynthia, Durnin
			and Zenon. One of these kingdoms is your home kingdom, the other 3 kingdoms will
			be referred to as foreign kingdoms. You must travel through 3 foreign kingdoms
			on your journey around the gameboard and discover a key in each kingdom...a brass
			key in the first foreign kingdom; a silver key in the second foreign kingdom; and
			a gold key in the third foreign kingdom. You will not find a key in your home
			kingdom. Each kingdom is made up of many territories. A territory is one game play
			space. Some of the territories contain such buildings as Ruins, Mines, Bazaars and
			Sanctuaries. The frontiers are the 4 long, narrow territories that separate the
			kingdoms from each other. A frontier is considered one game play space. Dark Tower
			spaces are the 4 spaces that surround the base of the tower. There is one Dark Tower
			space per kingdom. A Dark Tower space is considered a territory and one game play
			space. You can only enter a Dark Tower space at the end of the game when you are
			ready to lay siege to the tower.
		<p>
			Citadels are the starting spaces for your pawns on the board. There are 4
			Citadel territories. You are never allowed to move your pawn inta a foreign
			Citadel territory.
		<p>
			Move you warrior pawn by clicking into the desired territory. Or you may decide
			not to move your pawn to another territory but rather remain in your present
			territory. This is also acceptable. For example, if you're in the Bazaar, you
			may decide to remain in the same marketplace on your next turn to purchase more
			supples. Two or more pawns can be on the same territory at the same time.
		<p>
			Notice that the frontier spaces are extra long territories that border several
			territories in a kingdom. When leaving a frontier space to enter a new territory
			in a new kingdom, you may move your pawn to any one of the territories that border
			the frontier space.
		<p>
			You must move your pawn to 3 foreign kingdoms and discover a magic key in each
			kingdom. Then return back to your home kingdom to lay siege to the Dark Tower.
			Your movement around the board is counter-clockwise. Howerver, within each
			kingdom, you may travel in any direction you wish.
		<p>
			Each move of your pawn on the gameboard is accompanied with an action at the
			Dark Tower.

							First, you will hear a battle horn sound. Then you will see a flashing red number
							in the digital display window and a picture of the Brigands in the light-up window.
							These signals tell you how many brigands are attacking you. The first skirmish with
							your warriors is then fought. A new sequence of number and picture signals appears
							in the window. You'll see a picture of your Warriors and a number in the digital
							display which tells you how many warriors you have left after the first
							skirmish. This is followed by a Brigand picture and a number in the digital display
							which tells you how many brigands are left after the first skirmish. The the battle
							continues. More skirmishes are fought. Between skirmishes you will hear battle horns
							sound. Note that there is a different sound for winning and losing a skirmish! You
							will see all the action in the tower window. With each skirmish either the brigands
							or your warriors lose a number of their forces. The battle sequence continues until
							the brigands win and you lose or vice versa. Here's how you can tell when the battle
							is over:
						<p>
							<b>Brigands lose/you win...</b>in the final skirmish, the picture of the Warriors
							and their remaining number flash on in the tower. Then the Brigands picture appears
							with a digital display of zero. This means you have conquered all the brigands and
							your warriors have won the battle!
						<p>
							<b>Brigands win/you lose...</b>in the final skirmish of a losing battle, when you have
							only 2 warriors left (this is shown in the window), the brigands winning force will
							flash on in the window. You will hear a "Death March" sound and the final signal in
							the battle sequence will apprear...it is a picture of your Warriors with no numeral
							digital display indicating that you have been totally routed by the brigands band.
							Your warrior force is now cut down to one warrior!
						<p>
							<b>Important...</b>After you lose a battle in a multiple player game, the tower is
							programmed to always let you keep 1 warrior, so you will still have one fighting man
							left in your force. However, in a solo player game, if the battle sequence continues
							to the end and you lose, all your man will be taken from you and the game will be over.
						<p>
							<b>Retreating in battle...</b>If you wish, you do not have to partake in the entire
							battle sequence. If the brigands outnumber your warrior force and you think you may
							lose, press the <i>No / End</i> button at any time in the sequence. You will hear the
							"Death March" music and the Warriors picture will flash on the window with no number
							display. You will automatically lose at least on warrior when retreating.
						<p>
							<b>

						<p>
							<b>Please Note...</b>each warrior in your force is responsible for carrying a
							maximum of 6 bags of your gold. For example, if you have a total of 60 bags of
							gold and only 6 warriors, the most gold your force can carry is 36 bags. Because
							you do not have enough warriors to carry your gold, the tower will penalize you
							and take away all your excess gold. You can avoid being penalized if you owned

							your Dragonsword is good for one attack only. Once you use it to slay a dragon, it
							is no longer yours.
						<p>
							<b>Important...</b>after the dragon attacks you, place the dragon pawn on any
							territory except one with a building on it, a frontier territory, a Citadel or a
							Dark Tower space. When placing the dragon pawn on a territory, be sure to put it
							in a place that will block one of your opponents, for no player may move his pawn
							into a territory occupied by the dragon. The dragon pawn is only moved again when
							the dragon attacks again.

			You will hear the eerie sound of a creaking door and one of the following events
			will happen:
		<p>
			The Mine or Ruin will be deserted. Nothing will happen, no digital display will
			appear, no light-up picture will flash on. You will only hear the sound of a
			cracking door shut. Your turn is then over.
		<p>
			Or a battle with brigands will take place. You decide whether to fight it out or
			retreat. The same battle sequence described under the <i>Move</i> button will happen
			here. If you win the battle, you could be awarded some treasure...gold, a key, a wizard,
			Pegasus or a Dragonsword.

			You will hear a high-pitched trill. If you are in need of men, gold or food,
			the Sanctuary will give you what you need and the tower window will show you
			your new totals of these items. Here's how you qualify for aid: if you have
			4 warriors or less, the Sanctuary will give you bonus warriors; if you have
			7 bags of gold or less, the Sanctuary will give you bonus gold; if you have
			5 rations of food or less, the Sanctuary will give you bonus food.

			<b>
				The Citadel
			</b>
			You can not move your pawn into a Citadel territory in a foreign kingdom. You
			can only move your pawn into your own home Citadel territory. If you enter
			your home Citadel at the end of the game when you habe collected 3 keys, crossed
			all 4 frontiers and are ready to lay siege to the Dark Tower, you will get a
			special surprise. If you have between 5 and 24 warriors in your force, the
			number of warriors in your force will be doubled. If you don't have the specific
			number of men the Citadel will not double your men but will act as a Sanctuary
			and supply you with the usual bonuses of warriors, gold and food if you qualify
			for such add.
		<p>
			<b>Please Note...</b>The warrior-doubling can be an important strategy to take
			in preparation of your siege on the brigand force in the tower. You can revisit
			the Citadel and redouble your forces again only if you visit the Mine, Ruin,
			Bazaar or Dark Tower in your own kingdom in the interim.

							left. You must then try to get to a Bazaar and buy food or go to the Sanctuary
							for a free food bonus before you lose warriors to starvation. If you do run out
							of food before you get to a Bazaar or a Sanctuary, you will lose one warrior per

						<p>
							<b>How to buy food...</b>Food rations are purchased like warriors. Food rations,

							Move to the Dark Tower territory when you have fulfilled all of the following
							requirements: you have collected all 3 magic keys, you have crossed 4 frontiers
							and are back in your home kingdom and you are ready to begin your siege of the
							Dark Tower. When you move your pawn to the Dark Tower territory you will hear
							a few notes of the "1812 Overture" and the tower signal you to solve The Riddle
							of the Keys.
						<p>
							<b>The Riddle of the Keys...</b>in order to gain entry into the Dark Tower and
							to fight the final battle with the brigands within, you must unlock the tower
							by putting the keys into a special order (you must arrange the brass, silver
							and gold keys in proper numerical order)...this is called solving The Riddle
							of the Keys.
						<p>
							<b>Here's how to solve the riddle...</b>The order of the keys (which key is #1,
							#2 and #3) changes from game to game. After you moves your pawn to the Dark
							Tower territory and hear the musical overture, a picture of one of the keys and
							the digital number <i>1</i> will appear in the digital display. The tower is
							asking you if that particular key is key #1. You must respond by pressing either
							the <i>Yes / Buy</i> button or the <i>No / End</i> button. Pressing the
							<i>Yes / Buy</i> button will tell the tower, yes I think the key shown is key #1.
							Pressing the <i>No / End</i> button will tell the tower, show me more, I think
							another key might be key #1. If you continue to press the <i>No / End</i> button,
							all 3 keys will eventually flash on in the light-up window. When the key you think
							is key #1 appears, press the <i>Yes / Buy</i> button to tell the tower of your
							choice.
						<p>
							<b>
								If your first guess is correct,
							</b>
							a picture of one of the two remaining keys and the digital number <i>2</i> appear
							in the window. The tower is asking you if this particular key is key #2. Press
							<i>Yes / Buy</i> or <i>No / End</i> buttons as above to make your choice.
						<p>
							<b>
								If your first guess is incorrect,
							</b>
							you will hear a negative musical signal and your end of turn signal appears in the
							tower window indicating your turn is over. To properly end your turn, press the
							<i>No / End</i> button. Now you must wait for your next turn to guesss again.
							On your next turn, try again to pick key #1. As you can see, choosing the proper
							order of the keys is pure guess work and your correct choices are made through
							process of elimination.
						<p>
							Continue pressing <i>Yes / Buy</i> and <i>No / End</i> buttons to guess as above.
							Once you correctly choose key #2, you have successfully solved The Riddle of the
							Keys. The tower will not ask you to make your choice of key #3, since your answer
							will obviously be correct.
						<p>
							As soon as you correctly pick key #2, the Final Battle begins.
						<p>
							<b>Important...</b>if your first guess was correct but your second guess was
							incorrect, your turn is over. Wait until your next turn to pick key #2. On your
							next turn, the tower will ask you to identify key #1 again before it presents
							your choices for key #2. Press the proper <i>Yes / Buy</i> and <i>No / End</i>
							buttons to answer.
						<p>
							<b>
								To avoid confusion, the best advice
							</b>
							to follow is always watch the digital display and light-up window carefully so
							you'll know exactly what key and in which order it is being presented. You may
							press the <i>Repeat</i> button, if necessary.
						<p>
							<b>The Final Battle...</b>Once you have solved The Riddle of the Keys you must
							fight the brigand force within the Dark Tower. As soon as key #2 is properly
							picked, you'll hear a battle horn and the number of Brigands and their picture
							will appear in the window. You now know how many brigands are guarding the
							Ancient Scepter. During the battle you must make a critical decision, stay and
							fight or retreat. If you fight, the classic battle sequence with its many skirmishes
							will take place. If you retreat, head back to the Bazaar or your own home Citadel
							to gain more warriors, then head back to the tower again to lay siege. If you do
							retreat, when you attack the tower again, you must solve the riddle again (the
							sequence does not change) before the Final Battle will take place.
